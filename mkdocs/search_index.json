The url for the site is \nhere\n. On the button of the login page, there is a signup link. Click it!\n\n\n\n\nFill your information in the signup page. \nMake sure to read the \nTerms \n Conditions\n agreement and check the agree box before clicking the green signup button.\n\n\n\n\nThe system will send an email with an activation link. After clicking on the link, the Causal Web system shows a confirmation message.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the link in the email. Alternatively, click on the \n\"University\"\n button to login to the Causal Web via your Pitt/Harvard account.\n\n\n\n\nLogin to Causal Web Application\n\n\nInput your email address and password that you want to use to register with the Causal Web system. \nCheck the Remember Me checkbox if you would like the browser automatically log you in next time you visit.\n\n\n\n\nHere we go! You are now in the Causal Web application.\n\n\n\n\nUploading Your Dataset\n\n\nClick on the Data Management link on the navigation bar on the left side. There is a sub menu that will appear. Click on the Import Data link.\n\n\n\n\nYou can \nEITHER\n drag \n drop dataset file(s) into the dash-surrounded canvas \nOR\n \nyou can click on the \nBrowse\n button and choose the dataset file(s) you would like to upload to the Causal Web application. For testing purposes download this dataset: \nRetention.txt\n and upload it.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nImport Data\n panel shows the dataset upload progress as a percentage along with MD5 checksums (confirms that an uploaded file's contents are unchanged after upload) for each of uploaded files.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also pause the upload of files and resume later. In the case of a disrupted connection, you can resume the upload by repeating the previous steps. The Causal Web application will detect the unfinished upload and resume from the latest point of the last attempt.\n\n\nOnce all your dataset file(s) are all uploaded, the progress bar will show the \n(completed)\n sign.\n\n\nSummarizing Your Dataset\n\n\nBefore any analysis can proceed, the datasets need to be summarized. Specifically, you must indicate the delimiter used in the data file (tab vs. comma), and the types of variables found in the file. Once this is done, the Causal Web application will determine the number of columns (features) and rows (records) in the dataset. \n\n\nClick on the \nData Management\n menu on the navigation bar on the left side. The sub menu will slowly appear. Click on the \nDatasets\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset page shows a list of datasets and their attributes. On the second \nSummarized\n column from the right, the yellow warning buttons indicate that the system has not yet summarized.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the dataset's name's link to see the dataset information. From this stage, the data summary information is missing: the dataset needs to be summarized before conducting causal analysis.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the dataset page, click on the yellow warning button to summarize a dataset. The data summarization page shows information of the dataset, its basic information, and additional information that will be determined after summarization (a number of rows and columns). The bottom panel has two radio boxes for you to choose variable type (continuous or discrete), and delimiter (tab or comma). The Retention.txt dataset described above is tab-delimited and contains continous variables.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the dataset is summarized, the dataset page changes its sign to be a green button. Click to see the additional information of this summarized dataset.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the dataset's name's link to see the additional information.\n\n\n\n\nUploading the Prior Knowledge\n\n\nClick on the \nData Management\n menu on the navigation bar on the left side. There is a sub menu that will appear. \nClick on the \nImport Data\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nYou can EITHER drag \n drop prior knowledge file(s) into the dash-surrounded canvas OR \nyou can click on the Browse button and choose the prior knowledge file(s) you would like to upload to the CCD Web application. Note that the prior knowledge file needs to have \n.prior\n file extension.\n\n\n\n\nExecuting an Analysis on Your Dataset\n\n\nClick on the Causal Discovery menu on the navigation bar on the left side. The sub menu will slowly appear. \nClick on the desired algorithms. As of November 2016, \nFGS\n \n(Continuous)\n, \nFGS Discrete\n, and \nGFCI\n \n(Continuous)\n are the only supported algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDataset\n drop-down box contains a list of datasets that the system recognize. If those datasets are already uploaded and they are not displayed in the dataset drop-down box, it means that the \nData Summarization\n process to be reviewed in the first place prior to execute a causal \nFGS\n \n(Continuous)\n analysis. \nIf a prior knowledge file needs to be computed, Prior Knowledge File drop-down box contains a list of knowledge files. \nBefore clicking the \nNext\n button, the data validation parameters need to be input.\n\n\n\n\nHere, the \nFGS\n algorithm page allows user to modify its parameters. \n\n\n\n\nThe first one is Penalty Discount and its default value is 4. \n\n\nThe second one is Search Maximum Degree and its default value is 100. \n\n\nThe third one is Faithfulness Assumed and its default value is checked.\n\n\nThe fifth one is Verbose output and its default value is checked.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nNext\n to proceed or click Advanced Options (JVM) for the JVM customization.\n\n\n\n\nExpert Mode\n: the JVM parameters allow users to customize JVM parameters such how much maximum memory (in Gigabyte scale) the process would allocate (e.g. 4).\n\n\n\n\nThis is the summary page before the FGS job analysis is put into the queue. \nClick on the number 1 (Select Dataset) or number 2 (Set Parameters) to go back to modify the parameters. \nOnce, everything is set. Click the \nRun Algorithm!\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe application will redirect the \nJob Queue\n page. The analysis job is added to the queue. The \nQueued\n status means that it waits for the scheduler to run it once the executing slot is available. However, the \nJob Queue\n page does not currently automatically update the jobs' status (at least in this development stage). Refresh the \nJob Queue\n page from time to time to see the latest jobs' status.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the job slot is available, the queued job is then executed and its status changes to \nRunning\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the job is finished, it is automatically removed from the \nJob Queue\n page. The result of the analysis is added to the Results page.\n\n\n\n\nIn case the \nqueued\n or \nrunning\n job needs to be killed or removed, click the \nRemove\n button on the first column on the \nJob Queue\n page from the right. \nThe \nRemove Job\n confirmation page is popped up. Click \nYes\n to kill the job or \nNo\n to cancel the kill operation.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the job cancellation is confirmed, the job's status changes to \nKill Request\n. The scheduler will take care of removing of the job from the queue or killing a job in the server.\n\n\n\n\nIf the running job was killed or any error happened during the process, the error result will appear in the \nResults\n page. Its background is highlighted in red.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is an error, you will see the details of the error by clicking on error result link.\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Your Result\n\n\nClick on the \nResults\n menu on the navigation bar on the left side. \nClick on the \nAlgorithm Results\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nAlgorithm Results\n page shows a list of results, their creation time and their size. On the first column from the right, the green \nSave\n buttons provide the ability for users to download results to their local computers. \nClick on the result's name's link to see a causal graph of the result.\n\n\nCheck the result files on their checkboxes to \ncompare the results\n. \n\nNote\n: a number of comparing datasets can be more than two files.\n\n\n\n\nThe results page details the graph, the original dataset, and its parameters. \nClick on the \nView Full Screen\n button to see the causal graph in more detail.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows the causal graph in the full-screen mode.\n\n\n\n\nComparing Your Result\n\n\nClick on the \nResults\n menu on the navigation bar on the left side. To compare two results click on the Algorithm Results item on the left. Select at least two results (place a checkmark next to the results) and click on Compare. Now click on the \nResult Comparisions\n item on the left.\n\n\n\n\nThe Result Comparisons page shows a list of results, their creation time and their size. On the first column from the right, the green Save buttons provide the ability for users to download results to their local computers. Click on the result's name's the link to see the detail of the result comparisons.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nResult Comparisons\n page shows the datasets compared, and the table of edges, their mutual appearance in all comparing datasets, and their mutual endpoint types.\n\n\n\n\nDownloading Your Result And Comparision Result\n\n\nOn the first column from the right of the \nAlgorithm Results\n page, the green \nSave\n buttons provide the ability for users to download results to their local computers.\n\n\n\n\nOn the first column from the right of the \nResult Comparisions\n page, the green \nSave\n buttons provide the ability for users to download result comparisons to their local computers.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Your Feedback\n\n\nClick the \nFeedback\n menu on the navigation menu bar on the left. \nThe \nFeedback\n page shows the email (optional), and the text area for the user feedback (required). \nOnce, the feedback is filled, click the \nSend Feedback\n button.\n\n\n\n\nThe green \nThank you for you feedback!\n banner shows that the feedback submitted successfully.",
