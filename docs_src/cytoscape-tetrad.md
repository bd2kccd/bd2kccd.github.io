# cytoscape-tetrad

## Installation
Download the latest version of the plugin from our software repository

[Download the plugin](https://cloud.ccd.pitt.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/edu/pitt/dbmi/ccd/cytoscape/tetrad/cytoscape-tetrad-app)

To install the plugin start the Cytoscape application and click on apps->install from file and select the jar file.

## Using the Plugin
- When viewing a graph in Tetrad save the graph as Text.  Causal Command and Causal Web will also output this text file by default.
- In Cytoscape select the File->import->network->Tetrad option and select the file that you saved previously.  
- Apply a layout: By default Cytoscape doesn't apply a layout so the initial rendering will look like a single node.  Apply a layout by selecting Layout in the top menu and then choosing a layout to see your graph (e.g., Layouts->yFiles Layouts->Organic).
