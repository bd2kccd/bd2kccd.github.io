## Using the Plugin
- Put a graph box on the workspace and select graph type graph.  Click on File -> Save -> JSON.
- In Cytoscape select the File->import->network->Tetrad option and select the file that you saved previously.  
- Apply a layout: By default Cytoscape doesn't apply a layout so the initial rendering will look like a single node.  Apply a layout by selecting Layout in the top menu and then choosing a layout to see your graph (e.g., Layouts->Hierarchical).
